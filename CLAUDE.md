## Project Architecture

- **Languages**: TypeScript, French content
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Third-party**: Calendly (appointments), Formspree (contact forms), Plausible (analytics)

### Architecture Overview

**App Router Structure (`/app`)**:
- Pages follow French naming (e.g., `t√©moignages/`, `a-propos/`)
- Nested routes for legal domains: `domaines/famille/`, `domaines/contrats/`
- Automatic metadata generation and SEO optimization
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for legal services

**Components (`/components`)**:
- `layout/` - Header/Footer with responsive navigation
- `ui/` - Reusable UI components (DomainCard, TestimonialCard, etc.)
- `sections/` - Page-specific sections (Hero, etc.)

### Key Features

- **GDPR**: Privacy policy, consent forms, cookie-free analytics

## Custom Color Palette

The design uses a warm sienna and green professional theme:

```css
primary: '#882D17'        /* Dark sienna */
secondary: '#F5F1EC'      /* Light cream */
accent: '#E35336'         /* Orange accent */
green.primary: '#2F5233'  /* Dark forest green */
green.light: '#98A869'    /* Light olive */
green.mint: '#ADEBB3'     /* Mint green */
cream: '#FDFBD4'          /* Light cream */
```

## Content Management

**Placeholders to Replace**:
- Search for `[PLACEHOLDER]` tags throughout the codebase
- Key items: lawyer name, contact info, SIRET number, address
- Professional photo and assets in `/public`

**Legal Content**:
- All text is professionally written for French legal practice
- Testimonials and case studies included but need personalization  
- GDPR-compliant privacy policy and legal notices included
